       <h4>
          In case you were wondering where you would use this kind of app...
       </h4>
       <p>
          Let's say you are currently going to the gym and following a new routine which you don't know by heart, this is 
          exactly the time when you realise that you need something like this! 
       </p>
       <h6>
          If you use this web app you could do something like this:
       </h6>
       <p>
          Create a folder named gym, inside of it create a todo list for each day. Every single 
          one should contain all of it's respective exercises.
       </p>
       <h5> 
          Ohh, your problem was solved!!
       </h5>
       <h6>
          Then you realise that you can do the same thing for other unrelated activities and events like your: jobs, 
          life goals, programming projects, meals, homeworks,  etc...
       </h6>
       <h5> 
          It's up to you to find the perfect combinations for yourself!
       </h5>
       <h6>
          Or maybe for someone else in the near future?...

       <h4>
          Getting Started
       </h4>
       <label>
          Let's create our first item (folder or todo list), we would start by making a folder of todo lists:
       </label>
       <ol>
          <li>
             Make sure you are in the "Folders Page" by looking at the folder button's style in the inner menu, if not 
             you can just click our logo in the nav bar and it will take you there
          </li>
          <li> 
             Click on the "Create Item" button in the mini menu
          </li>
          <li>
             The folder creation form should pop-up. <b> Note: </b> Each item's name must be unique and only contain 
             alphanumeric characters, it's length should range from 3 to 14
          </li>
          <li>
             And Voila... If your name is available and follows our standards your item will be created and displayed 
             in your desktop. <b> Note: </b> To see a folder's description you must place the mouse over it and wait like 1.5 seconds
          </li>
       </ol>
       <label>
          Now let's go for a todo list inside of our new folder:
       </label>
       <ol>
          <li>
             Click on our new folder
          </li>
          <li> 
             Click the "Create List" button and follow the step 3 from the previous tutorial
          </li>
          <li>
             You can access your new list by clicking on it
          </li>
          <li>
             <b>
                Wow! Now the only thing left before you can go on your own is to remember that the 2 buttons in the top corner 
                of each item are used for updating(pencil) or removing(trash can) itself
             </b>
          </li>
       </ol>
    </div>
 </div>
